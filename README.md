## About Me
Hi! My name is Jamie Marshaleck (they/them), and I am a third-year English student at Lehigh University. <br/>
I write literary criticism, poetry, and pretty much anything else I think of and publish it to [my Substack!](https://substack.com/@jambam03) <br/>
I study journalism because I want to expand my writing techniques. <br/>
